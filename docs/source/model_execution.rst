Terminating vs. Steady-State Models

Simulation Execution Parameters
-------------------------------

Simulation models are executed using methods on the
:class:`~simprovise.simulation.Simulation` class.
**simprovise** supports two types of model execution:

* Single simulation runs, optionally with multiple batches (to support batch 
  means analysis).
* Multiple runs/replications of the simulation, using a different set of
  psuedo-random number streams for each replication.
